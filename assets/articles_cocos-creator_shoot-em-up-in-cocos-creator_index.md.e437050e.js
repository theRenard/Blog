The player can shoot <code>Projectiles</code> that destroy enemies. The game is over when the player&#39;s health is over. The UI is composed of a <code>ProgressBar</code> and a <code>Score</code>. There is also a <code>GameManager</code> node that hosts the script that manages the game as the <code>EnemyFactory</code> and the <code>ScoreKeeper</code>. We will see how these work in the next sections. You will also notice a parent node for the <code>Player</code> which is <code>ShipBoundaries</code>.

How ? It clones the node so that it can scroll infinitely. The two nodes forms a column that begin to scroll at a given speed, when the bottom one reaches the end of the canvas (and it is out of sight) it moves at the top of the other and the process repeats.
