The player can shoot <code>Lasers</code> that destroy enemies. The game is over when the player&#39;s health is over. The UI is composed of a <code>ProgressBar</code> and a <code>Score</code>. There is also a <code>GameManager</code> node that hosts the script that manages the game as the <code>EnemySpawner</code> and the <code>ScoreKeeper</code>. We will see how these work in the next sections. You will also notice a parent node for the <code>Player</code> which is <code>ShipBoundaries</code>.

The script attached to the camera is <a href="https://github.com/theRenard/cocos-creator-laser-defender/blob/master/assets/Scripts/CameraShake.ts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>CameraShake.ts</code></a> and it does exactly what it says, it shakes the camera. It&#39;s used when the player is hit by an enemy. The script is very simple, it just moves the camera in a random direction for a given amount of time. The camera is moved by changing the <code>position</code> and the <code>rotation</code> property of the node.</p><h2 id="background-and-foreground-nodes" tabindex="-1"><code>Background</code> and <code>Foreground</code> Nodes <a class="header-anchor" href="#background-and-foreground-nodes" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>These two nodes are placeholder for textures, the <code>Background</code> node has <code>Stars</code> and <code>Clouds</code> textures, those nodes are just sprites with a script attached.

How ? It clones the node so that it can scroll infinitely.
