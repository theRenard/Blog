The game&#39;s code is pretty simple and straightforward, also the components are really small. If you don&#39;t know how to code maybe a game is not the first thing you wanna do... even though it&#39;s a great way to learn.</li></ol><p>I will instead describe the logic behind the code and how the different scenes, nodes, and components work together.</p><p>Laser Defender is a game I&#39;ve learned thanks to this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Udemy course</a>. I&#39;ve decided to port it to Cocos Creator to see how it works and to compare it with Unity. I&#39;ve used Cocos Creator 3.6.2.</p><p>Another thing, I&#39;m not a game developer, I&#39;m a web developer, so I&#39;m sure there are better ways to do this, but this is how I did it.</p><p>All assets are from <a href="https://kenney.nl/assets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kenney</a>!

The player controls a spaceship that can move left and right and shoot. The enemies move toward the player and the player can shoot them. The game is over when the player&#39;s health is over. The player can collect power-ups that increase the player&#39;s health and the player&#39;s score. You can control it with a gamepad or with a keyboard.</p>',13),h=e("div",{class:"game-iframe"},[e("iframe",{src:"/games/laser-defender/index.html",title:"laser defender",frameborder:"0",style:{"aspect-ratio":"9 / 16"}})],-1),l=[s,h];function d(c,m,p,u,g,f){return t(),a("div",null,l)}const b=o(n,[["render",d]]);export{y as __pageData,b as default};
